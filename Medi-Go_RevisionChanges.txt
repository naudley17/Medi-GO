Medi-Go Revision Changes

- Remade the entire app using a Service-Oriented Architecture.
- We use React.js and Node.js as front end and back end frameworks respectively.
- CICD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions.

Node.js allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser, and using React.js 
we can create functional components which allows us to split the application into 
different parts. These functional components in React can return JSX code, and allows 
us to make custom HTML elements. As our React app needs to make web-service calls
(HTTP-requests) to connect to our database it turns it from a single-page-app to a
service-oriented app.
